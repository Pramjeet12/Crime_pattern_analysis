Crime Analytics using Time Series Forecasting



Overview:



This project focuses on utilizing time series forecasting techniques to analyze and predict crime rates. The main objective is to develop models that can effectively predict future crime occurrences based on historical data. The project implements various models including ARIMA, XGBoost, and Prophet to compare their performance in crime prediction.

Dataset



The dataset used in this project contains historical crime data, including various attributes such as location, time, type of crime, etc. It is crucial for training and evaluating the models.

:ARIMA
The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a popular time series forecasting method. It works by modeling the next time step in the sequence as a linear function of the observations at prior time steps.

:XGBoost
XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting library that is widely used for regression and classification problems. In this project, it is applied to the crime analytics task to capture complex patterns in the data.

:Prophet
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It is designed for analyzing time series data with strong seasonal patterns. Prophet automatically detects seasonality in the data and provides intuitive parameters for model tuning.



Results

The results of each model are evaluated based on various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and performance of each model in predicting crime rates.
